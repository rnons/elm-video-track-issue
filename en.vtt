00:00:12.702 --> 00:00:15.211
So, I have a feature on my website where every week

2
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:17.211
people submit hypothetical questions

3
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:18.799
for me to answer,

4
00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:21.180
and I try to answer them using math, science

5
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.640
and comics.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.048
So for example, one person asked,

7
00:00:25.048 --> 00:00:26.742
what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball

8
00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:29.148
pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?

9
00:00:29.148 --> 00:00:32.100
So I did some calculations.

10
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.367
Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,

11
00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.841
the air will flow around the object,

12
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.770
but in this case, the ball would be going so fast

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.221
that the air molecules wouldn't have time

14
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.840
to move out of the way.

15
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.827
The ball would smash right into and through them,

16
00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:45.488
and the collisions with these air molecules

17
00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:47.153
would knock away the nitrogen,

18
00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:49.111
carbon and hydrogen from the ball,

19
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:50.948
fragmenting it off into tiny particles,

20
00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:53.432
and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion

21
00:00:53.432 --> 00:00:54.960
in the air around it.

22
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.125
This would result in a flood of x-rays

23
00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.876
that would spread out in a bubble

24
00:00:58.876 --> 00:01:00.302
along with exotic particles,

25
00:01:00.302 --> 00:01:03.422
plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,

26
00:01:03.422 --> 00:01:06.964
and that would move away from the pitcher's mound

27
00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:09.449
slightly faster than the ball.

28
00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:12.131
Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,

29
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:14.034
the home plate is far enough away

30
00:01:14.034 --> 00:01:15.940
that light hasn't had time to reach it,

31
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.391
which means the batter

32
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:20.155
still sees the pitcher about to throw

33
00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.172
and has no idea that anything is wrong.

34
00:01:22.172 --> 00:01:24.444
(Laughter)

35
00:01:24.444 --> 00:01:26.870
Now, after 70 nanoseconds,

36
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.324
the ball will reach home plate,

37
00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:31.061
or at least the cloud of expanding plasma

38
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.190
that used to be the ball,

39
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.955
and it will engulf the bat and the batter

40
00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:40.416
and the plate and the catcher and the umpire

41
00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:43.221
and start disintegrating them all

42
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:46.387
as it also starts to carry them backward

43
00:01:46.387 --> 00:01:49.851
through the backstop, which also starts to disintegrate.

44
00:01:49.851 --> 00:01:51.621
So if you were watching this whole thing

45
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.928
from a hill,

46
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:56.301
ideally, far away,

47
00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:57.756
what you'd see is a bright flash of light

48
00:01:57.756 --> 00:01:59.262
that would fade over a few seconds,

49
00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:01.390
followed by a blast wave spreading out,

50
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.850
shredding trees and houses

51
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.969
as it moves away from the stadium,

52
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.901
and then eventually a mushroom cloud

53
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:12.662
rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)

54
00:02:12.662 --> 00:02:13.818
So the Major League Baseball rules

55
00:02:13.818 --> 00:02:15.922
are a little bit hazy,

56
00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:20.807
but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,

57
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:22.416
I think that in this situation,

58
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:24.869
the batter would be considered hit by pitch

59
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:27.503
and would be eligible to take first base,

60
00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:30.706
if it still existed.

61
00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:32.502
So this is the kind of question I answer,

62
00:02:32.502 --> 00:02:34.641
and I get people writing in with

63
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:36.515
a lot of other strange questions.

64
00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:39.062
I've had someone write and say,

65
00:02:39.062 --> 00:02:40.981
scientifically speaking, what is the best

66
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.051
and fastest way to hide a body?

67
00:02:43.051 --> 00:02:45.273
Can you do this one soon?

68
00:02:45.273 --> 00:02:47.133
And I had someone write in,

69
00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.148
I've had people write in about,

70
00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.352
can you prove whether or not you can find love again

71
00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:53.024
after your heart's broken?

72
00:02:53.024 --> 00:02:54.799
And I've had people send in

73
00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.790
what are clearly homework questions

74
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.933
they're trying to get me to do for them.

75
00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.838
But one week, a couple months ago,

76
00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:06.499
I got a question that was actually about Google.

77
00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:09.465
If all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards,

78
00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:12.144
how big would Google's data warehouse be?

79
00:03:12.144 --> 00:03:14.866
Now, Google's pretty secretive about their operations,

80
00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:18.242
so no one really knows how much data Google has,

81
00:03:18.242 --> 00:03:20.757
and in fact, no one really knows how many data centers Google has,

82
00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.248
except people at Google itself.

83
00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:24.482
And I've tried, I've met them a few times,

84
00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:29.705
tried asking them, and they aren't revealing anything.

85
00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:32.240
So I decided to try to figure this out myself.

86
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.399
There are a few things that I looked at here.

87
00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:36.305
I started with money.

88
00:03:36.305 --> 00:03:38.447
Google has to reveal how much they spend,

89
00:03:38.447 --> 00:03:40.437
in general, and that lets you put some caps

90
00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:44.223
on how many data centers could they be building,

91
00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.523
because a big data center costs a certain amount of money.

92
00:03:46.523 --> 00:03:48.955
And you can also then put a cap on

93
00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:51.286
how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up,

94
00:03:51.286 --> 00:03:53.238
which turns out, it's pretty sizable.

95
00:03:53.238 --> 00:03:55.175
I read a calculation at one point,

96
00:03:55.175 --> 00:03:56.640
I think Google has a drive failure

97
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.894
about every minute or two,

98
00:03:59.894 --> 00:04:01.244
and they just throw out the hard drive

99
00:04:01.244 --> 00:04:02.630
and swap in a new one.

100
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.830
So they go through a huge number of them.

101
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.941
And so by looking at money,

102
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:08.790
you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have.

103
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.650
You can also look at power.

104
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.547
You can look at how much electricity they need,

105
00:04:14.547 --> 00:04:16.354
because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers,

106
00:04:16.354 --> 00:04:18.393
and Google is more efficient than most,

107
00:04:18.393 --> 00:04:21.490
but they still have some basic requirements,

108
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.406
and that lets you put a limit

109
00:04:23.406 --> 00:04:25.353
on the number of servers that they have.

110
00:04:25.353 --> 00:04:29.544
You can also look at square footage and see

111
00:04:29.544 --> 00:04:30.820
of the data centers that you know,

112
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.173
how big are they?

113
00:04:32.173 --> 00:04:33.095
How much room is that?

114
00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:35.455
How many server racks could you fit in there?

115
00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:37.158
And for some data centers,

116
00:04:37.158 --> 00:04:39.147
you might get two of these pieces of information.

117
00:04:39.147 --> 00:04:40.843
You know how much they spent,

118
00:04:40.843 --> 00:04:43.200
and they also, say, because they had to contract

119
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.619
with the local government

120
00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:46.299
to get the power provided,

121
00:04:46.299 --> 00:04:48.956
you might know what they made a deal to buy,

122
00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.710
so you know how much power it takes.

123
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.004
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,

124
00:04:53.004 --> 00:04:54.533
and figure out for a data center

125
00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:56.169
where you don't have that information,

126
00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:57.261
you can figure out,

127
00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:59.448
but maybe you only have one of those,

128
00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:01.127
you know the square footage, then you could figure out

129
00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:03.450
well, maybe the power is proportional.

130
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.770
And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities,

131
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.846
you know, with guesses about the total amount of storage,

132
00:05:07.846 --> 00:05:10.439
the number of servers, the number of drives per server,

133
00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:13.486
and in each case using what you know

134
00:05:13.486 --> 00:05:16.013
to come up with a model that narrows down

135
00:05:16.013 --> 00:05:18.143
your guesses for the things that you don't know.

136
00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:20.408
It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get.

137
00:05:20.408 --> 00:05:22.963
And this is a lot of fun.

138
00:05:22.963 --> 00:05:25.145
The math is not all that advanced,

139
00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:28.280
and really it's like nothing more than

140
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.292
solving a sudoku puzzle.

141
00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:35.601
So what I did, I went through all of this information,

142
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.360
spent a day or two researching.

143
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.399
And there are some things I didn't look at.

144
00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.442
You could always look at the Google

145
00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:44.259
recruitment messages that they post.

146
00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.197
That gives you an idea of where they have people.

147
00:05:46.197 --> 00:05:47.808
Sometimes, when people visit a data center,

148
00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:49.653
they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,

149
00:05:49.653 --> 00:05:51.143
and they aren't supposed to,

150
00:05:51.143 --> 00:05:53.956
but you can learn things about their hardware that way.

151
00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:56.509
And in fact, you can just look at pizza delivery drivers.

152
00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:59.164
Turns out, they know where all the Google data centers are,

153
00:05:59.164 --> 00:06:02.040
at least the ones that have people in them.

154
00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.225
But I came up with my estimate,

155
00:06:04.225 --> 00:06:06.089
which I felt pretty good about,

156
00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:09.338
that was about 10 exabytes of data

157
00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:11.760
across all of Google's operations,

158
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.192
and then another maybe five exabytes or so

159
00:06:15.192 --> 00:06:17.237
of offline storage in tape drives,

160
00:06:17.237 --> 00:06:18.812
which it turns out Google is

161
00:06:18.812 --> 00:06:21.322
about the world's largest consumer of.

162
00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:24.883
So I came up with this estimate, and this is

163
00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:26.126
a staggering amount of data.

164
00:06:26.126 --> 00:06:29.000
It's quite a bit more than any other organization

165
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.747
in the world has, as far as we know.

166
00:06:30.747 --> 00:06:32.493
There's a couple of other contenders,

167
00:06:32.493 --> 00:06:34.837
especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.

168
00:06:34.837 --> 00:06:36.266
But using some of these same methods,

169
00:06:36.266 --> 00:06:38.289
we can look at the NSA's data centers,

170
00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.771
and figure out, you know, we don't know what's going on there,

171
00:06:40.771 --> 00:06:42.861
but it's pretty clear that their operation

172
00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.458
is not the size of Google's.

173
00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:46.197
Adding all of this up, I came up with

174
00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.093
the other thing that we can answer, which is,

175
00:06:48.093 --> 00:06:50.078
how many punch cards would this take?

176
00:06:50.078 --> 00:06:53.036
And so a punch card can hold

177
00:06:53.036 --> 00:06:55.027
about 80 characters,

178
00:06:55.027 --> 00:06:58.800
and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,

179
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.074
and you put them in, say,

180
00:07:00.074 --> 00:07:02.026
my home region of New England,

181
00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:04.366
it would cover the entire region

182
00:07:04.366 --> 00:07:07.840
up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,

183
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.283
which is about three times deeper

184
00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:11.682
than the glaciers during the last ice age

185
00:07:11.682 --> 00:07:13.850
about 20,000 years ago.

186
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.273
So this is impractical, but I think

187
00:07:16.273 --> 00:07:19.224
that's about the best answer I could come up with.

188
00:07:19.224 --> 00:07:21.362
And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.

189
00:07:21.362 --> 00:07:25.052
And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,

190
00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:26.683
because of course they've been so secretive,

191
00:07:26.683 --> 00:07:28.087
they didn't answer of my questions,

192
00:07:28.087 --> 00:07:29.594
and so I just put it up and said,

193
00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:31.117
well, I guess we'll never know.

194
00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:33.141
But then a little while later

195
00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.590
I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,

196
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.032
saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.

197
00:07:39.032 --> 00:07:41.833
So I go and get it, open it up,

198
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:44.360
and it's punch cards. (Laughter)

199
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.442
Google-branded punch cards.

200
00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.690
And on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes,

201
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:51.991
and I said, thank you, thank you,

202
00:07:51.991 --> 00:07:53.510
okay, so what's on here?

203
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.140
So I get some software and start reading it,

204
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:57.140
and scan them, and it turns out

205
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.509
it's a puzzle.

206
00:07:58.509 --> 00:08:00.147
There's a bunch of code,

207
00:08:00.147 --> 00:08:01.401
and I get some friends to help,

208
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:03.953
and we crack the code, and then inside that is another code,

209
00:08:03.953 --> 00:08:05.248
and then there are some equations,

210
00:08:05.248 --> 00:08:06.419
and then we solve those equations,

211
00:08:06.419 --> 00:08:09.890
and then finally out pops a message from Google

212
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.079
which is their official answer to my article,

213
00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:15.531
and it said, "No comment."

214
00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:21.705
(Laughter) (Applause)

215
00:08:26.112 --> 00:08:29.329
And I love calculating these kinds of things,

216
00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:31.044
and it's not that I love doing the math.

217
00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:32.609
I do a lot of math,

218
00:08:32.609 --> 00:08:35.685
but I don't really like math for its own sake.

219
00:08:35.685 --> 00:08:37.635
What I love is that it lets you take

220
00:08:37.635 --> 00:08:39.035
some things that you know,

221
00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:43.813
and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper,

222
00:08:43.813 --> 00:08:45.510
find out something that you didn't know

223
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.690
that's very surprising.

224
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.366
And I have a lot of stupid questions,

225
00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:51.169
and I love that math gives the power

226
00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:53.926
to answer them sometimes.

227
00:08:53.926 --> 00:08:55.453
And sometimes not.

228
00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:58.377
This is a question I got from a reader,

229
00:08:58.377 --> 00:08:59.550
an anonymous reader,

230
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.595
and the subject line just said, "Urgent,"

231
00:09:01.595 --> 00:09:03.524
and this was the entire email:

232
00:09:03.524 --> 00:09:06.286
"If people had wheels and could fly,

233
00:09:06.286 --> 00:09:08.982
how would we differentiate them from airplanes?"

234
00:09:08.982 --> 00:09:11.657
Urgent. (Laughter)

235
00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:15.010
And I think there are some questions

236
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:17.680
that math just cannot answer.

237
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.151
Thank you.

238
00:09:20.151 --> 00:09:24.501
(Applause)
